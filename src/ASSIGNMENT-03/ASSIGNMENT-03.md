## Main Challanges

My main challange is the lack of experience with Azure envrionments.

However, the requiremetns were pretty straight forward, and so, I
started with reviewing the tools available to work with terrafom and
Azure.
The tool that seems to be a good fit, is the [aztexport](https://github.com/Azure/aztfexport)
utility, which exports an existing azure state into a collecton of
terraform plan files.

This helped me with understanding the particulars of how azure
objects/hirarchies/relationships work.
